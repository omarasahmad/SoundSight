# SoundSightAR

## Core Goal
The primary goal is to build a system that translates real-time auditory information
(music, speech, environmental sounds) into visual or haptic feedback to support
the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community.

### Objectives
- Real-time classification of common sounds (siren, door knock, baby crying, etc.)
- Visual or AR-based representation of these sounds with varying color/shape intensities
- Low-latency, accurate detection even in noisy environments

### Proposed Value
- Increase awareness and inclusivity for individuals with hearing impairments
- Help users perceive critical audio cues (alarms, alerts) in everyday life
- Showcase cutting-edge ML and AR integration
